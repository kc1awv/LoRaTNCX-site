# LoRaTNCX User Manual

## About This Manual

This user manual is organized into separate files for easier maintenance and contribution. Each section focuses on a specific aspect of LoRaTNCX usage and configuration.

This manual assumes a basic understanding of amateur radio, LoRa technology, and general computing concepts.

### Caveat

- The manual was initially written mostly by various LLMs with human oversight and editing by S. Miller KC1AWV. Omissions and errors on this site should be reported via the [repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/kc1awv/LoRaTNCX-site/issues). No LLM or automated tool can perfectly understand all the nuances of amateur radio regulations, best practices, or specific user scenarios. Users should verify critical information independently and offer their own expertise where applicable.

- Start with [Section 1: Introduction](manual/introduction) if you're new to LoRaTNCX
